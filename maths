 # Find Maximum of two numbers in Python
Toys = 58
maps = 95
if Toys < maps :
    print(f"maps is bigger {maps}")
else:
    print(f"toys is small {Toys}")


# another way 
a = 70
b = 35
print(max(a,b))
print(min(a,b))

# minus can have various way 
calculation = lambda s,d:s-d
print(calculation(58,65))

# using "f function"
u,t = 58,89
print(f"The out come {u}-{t} all around {u-t}")
